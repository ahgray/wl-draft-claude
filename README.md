## üèÜ Post-Draft Analysis Features

### Automatically Available After Draft Completion
- **Draft Grade (A-F):** Your performance vs expected value at your draft position
- **Prize Probabilities:** Monte Carlo simulation of win/loss prize chances for all drafters
- **Strategy Analysis:** Detects each drafter's strategy (WIN_FOCUSED, LOSS_FOCUSED, BALANCED)
- **Best/Worst Picks:** Identifies biggest value picks and reaches of the draft
- **Final Standings Prediction:** Predicted finish order with confidence levels
- **Smart Insights:** Personalized recommendations based on your performance

### Visualizations
- **Prize Probability Matrix:** Scatter plot showing each drafter's win/loss chances
- **Performance Metrics:** Tables with your results highlighted
- **Value Analysis:** Complete breakdown of every pick's value

## Key Metrics Explained

- **Expected Wins/Losses:** Mean from simulations
- **P90 Wins/Losses:** 90th percentile (upside potential)
- **Playoff Prob:** Chance of 10+ wins
- **Top Pick Prob:** Chance of 3 or fewer wins
- **Value Score:** Combined metric for draft value
- **Performance Ratio:** Your actual value vs expected value (>1.0 = above expected)

## Tips for Success

1. **Don't show your hand early** - Keep opponents guessing
2. **Watch for runs** - If 2+ drafters take bad teams, pivot to wins
3. **Block sparingly** - Only when opponent is clear threat
4. **Trust the simulations** - They account for schedule strength
5. **Stay flexible** - Best strategy depends on what others do

## Troubleshooting

- **"No cached data found"**: Run `python test_system.py` first
- **Slow performance**: Reduce simulations in `monte_carlo.py`
- **Missing teams**: Check team abbreviations match NFL standards
- **Post-draft analysis not loading**: Ensure all 32 teams have been drafted
- **Snake draft order incorrect**: Check that `get_current_drafter()` is working properly

## Advanced Features

- Works for any draft position (1-8) with position-specific strategies
- Complete post-draft analysis with Monte Carlo prize probability calculations
- Real-time strategy detection and effectiveness scoring
- Export results for post-draft analysis  
- Adjust strategy weights in real-time
